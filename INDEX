cstPiecewise            Categorizes continuous predictors using
                        piecewise constant functions.
piecewiseLasso          Categorizes continuous predictors using
                        piecewise constant functions, runs a Lasso
                        regression and calculates selection
                        probabilities
plotPiecewiseLasso      Plot the Lasso estimates in terms of variation
                        of OR and selection probabilities, represented
                        by a light to dark gradient of gray (the
                        darker, the more stable the results are).
simulation              Simulates CBC data from mean vector and
                        covariance matrix
weightSettings          Graphical help to choose the weighting of the
                        classes Performs a k-fold cross-validation with
                        several weighting using the piecewiseLasso
                        function and then produces a plot showing
                        recall and precision for each weigthing.
